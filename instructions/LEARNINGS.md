# Technical Learnings & Decisions

This document tracks important technical decisions, solutions to problems, and key learnings during the development of TubeBase.

## Technical Decisions

### Next.js 14 App Router
- **Decision**: Use Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Rationale**: 
  - Better performance with React Server Components
  - Improved routing and layouts
  - Built-in optimizations for static and dynamic content
  - Strong TypeScript support

### Supabase
- **Decision**: Use Supabase for database and auth
- **Rationale**:
  - PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities
  - Built-in authentication and Row Level Security
  - Strong TypeScript support
  - Scalable and cost-effective

### Cloudflare R2
- **Decision**: Use R2 for storage
- **Rationale**:
  - S3-compatible API
  - Cost-effective for our use case
  - Global distribution
  - Strong performance

## Solutions
### Authentication
- Using Supabase Auth for simplified user management
- Implementing Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection
- Middleware for session handling

### Video Processing
- Using Python for video processing due to robust libraries
- pytube for metadata extraction (lightweight, efficient)
- youtube-transcript-api for reliable transcript access
- Async processing to prevent request timeouts
- Child process spawning for Python integration

### Data Storage
- Supabase for structured data and real-time capabilities
- Cloudflare R2 for cost-effective asset storage
- Redis for performance optimization

### Database Integration
