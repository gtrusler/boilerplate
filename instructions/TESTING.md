# Testing Guidelines

## Test Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Critical paths must have 100% coverage
- Test both success and error cases
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Test component rendering and interactions
- Verify authentication flows

## Testing Patterns
### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions and components
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Keep tests focused and minimal
- Use proper test isolation

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Verify API integrations
- Test database operations
- Check authentication flows
- Validate form submissions

### E2E Tests
- Test critical user journeys
- Verify production builds
- Test cross-browser compatibility
- Check mobile responsiveness
- Validate deployment configurations

## Mock Guidelines
- Mock external services
- Use consistent mocking patterns
- Document mock assumptions
- Keep mocks simple and maintainable
- Update mocks with API changes
- Use proper typing for mocks
