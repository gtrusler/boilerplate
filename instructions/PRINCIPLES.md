# Development Principles

## Code Quality Priorities
### Readability over Cleverness
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Use descriptive names
- Keep logic simple and straightforward
- Avoid clever tricks or optimizations
- Prioritize maintainability

### Simplicity over Premature Optimization
- Start with simple, working solutions
- Optimize only when necessary
- Profile before optimizing
- Document optimization decisions
- Consider maintenance cost

### Maintainability over Perfect Abstractions
- Keep abstractions practical
- Avoid over-engineering
- Consider future maintenance
- Document complex patterns
- Balance flexibility and simplicity

## Optimization Guidelines
- Profile before optimizing
- Document performance bottlenecks
- Consider scalability implications
- Test optimizations thoroughly
- Monitor performance metrics
- Use appropriate data structures

## Architectural Principles
### Separation of Concerns
- Clear component boundaries
- Modular design
- Single responsibility
- Clear data flow
- Proper state management

### Progressive Enhancement
- Core functionality first
- Enhance for modern browsers
- Maintain accessibility
- Consider performance
- Support offline capabilities

### Security First
- Implement proper authentication
- Use secure defaults
- Validate all inputs
- Follow security best practices
- Regular security audits
